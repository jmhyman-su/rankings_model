# Title: Mixed Model Model Fit-----------------------------
# Author: Skylar Shibayama

# This script fits the season-long mixed model and writes 5 csvs to the Predictions (plus year and gender) folder:
# 1. Season-to-date game-level predictions (both sequential and holdout) titled pred_1v2_df.csv
# 2. Current filtered player ratings titled player_ratings_1v2_df.csv
# 3. Current youth player ratings titled youth_player_ratings_1v2_df.csv
# 4. A record of unfiltered full season player ratings titled player_ratings_1v2_df_full.csv
# 5. A backup copy of #2 with date included as a record titled player_ratings_1v2_df_[Date].csv

# Preload----------------------

# Seed Set-------------------
# Seed is set to 1 for consistent retroactive comparisons (should have a marginal effect on mixed model fitting)

# Google Sheets Load------------------
# Here we load data from two google sheets:
# 1. Fwango URLs that includes tournament titles, URLs, and model use status
# 2. USA Roundnet Membership_Rankings Committee Filtered List, which (is supposed to) show membership and USA status for all players

# 2. pool_weight, which is the weight of a pool play game compared to bracket. Value of 1 means equal weight, value of .5 means pool play games count half as much as bracket.
